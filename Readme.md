# 🧪 Control of a Driven Qubit System Through Optimization Methods 📈

---

The aim of this project is to implement a procedure to control a driven qubit system through numerical minimization. This project serves as the basis for the development of a scientific paper.

## 📚 System Overview

### 🛠️ System Preparation
In terms of Quantum Information Science, superconducting quantum circuits are a promising platform for quantum computing. Within this framework, the transmon qubit is a widely used system, where it can be coupled to a superconducting resonator, whereas the interaction between the qubit and the resonator can be used to manipulate the dynamics of the qubit. The applications for this control can be visualized in the implementation of quantum gates, quantum algorithms, quantum metrology, quantum simulation, among others.

The system preparation involves initializing the qubit in the ground state and the cavity in the vacuum state. The initial condition is set to Resonator-Transmon coupling with interaction with a drive field. The Hamiltonian describing the system includes terms for the resonator, transmon qubit, and the interaction between them.

### ⚙️ Control and Measurement
Control is executed by applying a classical field to the system, represented by a generic function expanded in a Fourier series. The control field is applied for a specific duration, during which measurements are taken to evaluate the occupation of the qubit. The loss function, calculated from these measurements, quantifies the distance between the target state and the actual state of the system.

### 📉 Cost Function and Optimization
Different cost functions are defined based on the intended output and the minimization algorithm used. The goal is to minimize the cost function with respect to the control field, achieved through numerical optimization methods.

## 📦 Project Structure
The project consists of a single notebook file: 
- `Control_of_a_Driven_Qubit_System_Through_Optimization_Methods.ipynb`: Python notebook containing the implementation of the control system.

Results files are stored in the `results` folder.

## 📂 Additional Minimizations
The `additional_minimizations` folder contains extra results for other minimization parameters.

## 🔬 Usage
To run the notebook, ensure that the necessary libraries (numpy, scipy, qutip, numba, matplotlib) are installed. Then, execute the notebook for implementing control of the driven qubit system through optimization methods.

## 📊 Results
It was possible to develop a reproducible optimization protocol with good performance for the control of the system analyzed. This protocol allows for precise manipulation of the driven qubit system, paving the way for further research and applications in quantum computing and related fields.
